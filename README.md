# 模组介绍  Mod Description 
模组的灵感来源于LOL的海克斯大乱斗，最近刚好也在做整合包，所以就写了这个支持库。

This mod was inspired by League's ARAM, and since I was working on a modpack anyway, I ended up writing this library to support it.

## 它能做什么  What does it do
就像肉鸽游戏一样，当你完成某件事时，你可以在三个BUFF中选择一项来增强自己。

Just like in a roguelike game, upon completing a certain objective, you can choose one of three buffs to empower yourself.

## 关于指令 About Command

- /hextech  
    - common
    - rare
    - epic
    - legendary

本模组内置四种奖池，代表了海克斯的稀有度与强度，但并未内置任何海克斯。

This mod includes four built-in loot pools, which represent the rarity and power level of the Hextech enhancements, but it does not include any actual Hextech abilities itself.

## 如何使用 How to use it

如果你只是一个普通玩家，请忽视。

If you are just a regular player, you can ignore this.
